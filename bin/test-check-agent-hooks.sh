# Self-test for the three hooks in `.claude/hooks/`. Feeds each one a crafted hook payload on stdin
# and asserts its verdict.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. docs/agent-harness.md's own rule 3 is "give it a negative control - make it go red
# on purpose before you trust it". The harness shipped without applying that rule to itself, and a
# review found six defects in one 25-line parser, four of which let the exact mistake the hook is
# named after straight through while two blocked legitimate merges. Every one of those is a case
# below. A hook is unusually easy to get wrong this way: it runs inside another process, its output
# is consumed by a model rather than a person, and a broken one looks identical to a quiet one.
#
# WHY THE `test-check-` PREFIX, given there is no `bin/check-agent-hooks.sh`. bin/AGENTS.md pairs
# `test-check-X.sh` with `check-X.sh`, and this is a deliberate exception: the prefix is also what
# grants a script to the review agent by pattern, and a self-test for the harness is exactly the
# thing a reviewer should be able to run. It stays inside the grant's boundary - read-only, no
# network, no writes outside its own mktemp directory.
#
# Run: bin/test-check-agent-hooks.sh

# Resolved from $0, never from the caller's cwd. inject-merge-checklist.sh finds its checklist via
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR or `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, so running this script from a DIFFERENT
# checkout of this repo - the primary one, a sibling worktree on another branch - silently pointed
# the hook at that tree's docs/ instead of this branch's. On a branch without the checklist the
# hook exits 0 and the assertions below read the absence as "not injected". That is the failure
# this file exists to catch, in this file: pinning the root makes the test measure the branch it
# ships with, wherever it is run from.
